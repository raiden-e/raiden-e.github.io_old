            <span class=h3>C</span>roatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a country at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe on the Adriatic Sea. It borders Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a maritime border with Italy to the west and southwest.
        </div>
         Its capital and largest city, Zagreb, forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, with twenty counties. Here we met cool people from Australia, shared some cool stories and had many laughs.
