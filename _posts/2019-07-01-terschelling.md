            <span class=h3>T</span>erschelling is a municipality and an island in the northern Netherlands, one of the West Frisian Islands and is situated between the islands of Vlieland and Ameland.

        Wadden Islanders are known for their resourcefulness in using anything and everything that washes ashore (like a couple of crates filled with sneakers for example). With few trees to use for timber, most of the farms and barns are built with masts recovered from shipwrecks. The islands are surrounded by shipwrecks, and even today many containers wash ashore that are blown off the decks of container ships in the North Sea.
